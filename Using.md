# Using Futures

This first part focuses on manipulating `Future`s returned from an API.

The second part will explain how to instanciate your own futures.



@[FileIo Future Demo]({
    "stubs": [
        "src/main/scala/com/worldline/future/using/FileIo.scala",
        "src/test/scala/com/worldline/future/using/TestUsing.scala"
     ],
    "command": "com.worldline.future.using.TestUsing"
})
